A simple and efficient desktop application built using **Electron.js**, designed to automatically organize files in real-time.

### ✅ What You Should Do Now

- Put your actual image in the `assets/` folder and replace `./assets/screenshot.png` with the correct name.
- Update the GitHub repo URL and contact links.
- (Optional) Add instructions for packaging the app (`electron-builder`, etc.) if you're planning to share an installable version.

Let me know if you'd like me to add a **GIF demo**, **installation instructions**, or create a **preview image** of your UI for better visual impact.
